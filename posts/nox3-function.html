    <p>
      I’ve been working on a NOX-III for a while now. They’re everywhere in the West Blocks, and while most of them look dead or locked, some units still boot. Sort of.
    </p>

    <p>
      The boot process is slow and noisy — like it’s trying to remember something. The OS isn’t like anything we had back on Earth. Feels like a stitched-up version of old Linux with weird synthetic delays. Interface jumps forward, freezes, jumps again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Files echo. You delete something and it reappears in another folder hours later. Not copied — relocated. Logs keep shifting names. Some entries are dated before the machine was even found.

      This image is from Unit #117C. Same model as the one in South Node storage.
