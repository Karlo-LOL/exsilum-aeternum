    <p>
      I’ve been using a NOX-III unit in Block E for a few weeks now, and I think I’m starting to figure out how they run — or at least how they <i>pretend</i> to.

      They boot through what looks like a hybrid OS, probably derived from earlier NOX-I and NOX-II builds (which are no longer supported). Storage is oddly structured — sectors seem to loop or alias each other, which might explain the recurring file echoes people keep reporting.

      What’s weird is that the input lag varies by location. On certain floors, typing is smooth. On others, it’s delayed by almost a full second. And in one case, the machine tried to predict my input — before I typed it.

    <p>
      If anyone’s pulled one apart physically, drop pics. I’d kill to see what kind of hardware's under the shell.

      <li><b>ForkBomb:</b> They’re not predicting. They’re syncing with cached ghost sessions. Seen it happen on a NOX-II once.</li>
      <li><b>Nancy_5:</b> Mine types random text at night. Same room, different times. Not user error.</li>
      <li><b>BlindData:</b> Can confirm lag varies. Thought it was just my brain going.</li>
      <li><b>ArchiveAdmin:</b> Official breakdowns not approved. Be careful with hardware tampering.</li>
