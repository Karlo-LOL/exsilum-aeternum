      I wanted to help Pilgrin but i couldn't find him.
    </p>

    <p>
      I tried finding him but he was nowhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      I went to a nearby block in an attempt to find a NOX computer to contact him.
    </p>

    <p>
      I inserted my harddrive and entered the code. He was dead silent.
    </p>

    <p>
      I haven't heard from him in days. I don't have hope.
    </p>

    <p>
      I found a way to get access to his files, this is what he wrote: "I can't go outside, I have no hope. I'm just slowly fading away. :'("
    </p>

     <p>
      The file was taken from Block K, not J. He lied.
    </p>

    <p>
      I tracked the signal to a door, it was jammed tight.
    </p>

     <p>
      I don't think i will be hearing from him again. Ever.
    </p>

    <p>
      Is this my own doing? Am I the one to blame?
    </p>
