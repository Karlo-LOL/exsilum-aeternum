    <p>
      I was waiting for a train that never arrived, eventually i fell asleep and woke up a few hours later, alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      I tried going up the stairs but they were gone, now a hallway (image 1) was in its place, i was walking trough it for quite a while until i found a staircase.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunatley it didnt lead out but rather into another hallway, by following it I got to another station (image 2).
    </p>

    <p>
      I waited at the station and after about few minutes a train arrived. I took it just wanting to get out of here.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was on it for hours, alone. I was bored so I skedched out the train's interior on a notebook I had (image 3).
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually I arrived at a diffrent station, the sign read "office". I went up the stairs and entered an office building.
    </p>

     <p>
      After a bit of exploring around I found this, a NOX-IV. I booted it up and using the instructions that were in the drawer I interted the harddrive and activated the node. I logged in and started researching.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is when I realised i wouldn't be leaving. Ever.
    </p>

     <p>
      The office had a room with couches so I took one and brought it to my room. It was heavy but i was tired and wanted to sleep.
    </p>

    <p>
      I brought it to my room, closed the door and put the couch on the door. I don't want anything disturbing my sleep.
    </p>

    <p>
      I did't sleep at all. I think this place gave me insomnia or something.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don't want to leave. What if there is something out there? I have been staying in this room for who knows how many days.
    </p>

    <p>
      Is there something out there?
