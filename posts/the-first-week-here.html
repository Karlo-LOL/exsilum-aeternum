    <p>
      I’ve been using a NOX-III unit in Block E for a few weeks now, and I think I’m starting to figure out how they run — or at least how they <i>pretend</i> to.
    </p>

    <p>
      They boot through what looks like a hybrid OS, probably derived from earlier NOX-I and NOX-II builds. Storage is oddly structured — sectors seem to loop or alias each other, which might explain the recurring file people keep reporting.
    </p>

    <p>
      What’s weird is that the input lag varies by location. On certain floors, typing is smooth. On others, it’s delayed by almost a full second. And in one case, the machine tried to predict my input — before I typed it.
    </p>

    <p>
      If anyone’s pulled one apart physically, drop pics. I’d kill to see what kind of hardware's under the shell.

      <li>04/11/2021, 19:24 — <b><a href="users/ForkBomb.html">ForkBomb</a>:</b> Can confirm lag varies. Thought it was just my brain going.</li>
      <li>01/03/2019, 03:01 — <b><a href="users/Nancy51.html">Nancy51</a>:</b> Mine types random text at night. Same room, different times. My friend experienced it too.</li>
      <li>07/04/2022, 21:02 — <b><a href="users/BlindData.html">BlindData</a>:</b> They’re not predicting. They’re syncing with cached ghost sessions. Seen it happen on a NOX-II once.</li>
      <li>07/04/2023, 21:37 — <b><a href="users/D100real.html">D100real</a>(OP):</b> I think it can predict actually. I tried writing sex but it kept on automatically writing second, lol.</li>
      <li>08/04/2023, 18:52 — <b><a href="users/BlindData.html">BlindData</a>:</b> I did a bit more digging and found out that you can disable it in "Debug Mode" under "Writing, Inputs, and Grammar" named as "QPPW Testing"</li>
      <li>08/04/2023, 19:12 — <b><a href="users/D100real.html">D100real</a>(OP):</b> Weird, what does QPPW even stand for?</li>
      <li>08/04/2023, 19:34 — <b><a href="users/BlindData.html">BlindData</a>:</b> I don't know, this is an old OS so test features make sense to be prominent.</li>
      <li>08/04/2023, 19:41 — <b><a href="users/D100real.html">D100real</a>(OP):</b> Yeah, makes sense. Maybe an Admin will solve it.</li>
      <li>08/04/2023, 19:58 — <b><a href="users/BlindData.html">BlindData</a>:</b> Probably not, but newer OS versions could have an awnser, or someone could try decoding the OS to find the full name?</li>
      <li>08/04/2023, 20:03 — <b><a href="users/D100real.html">D100real</a>(OP):</b> Good ideas, but I don't know anyone with a NOX-IV or above, nor anyone who knows how to decode an OS. I hope someone who can finds this post.</li>
      <li>08/04/2023, 20:07 — <b><a href="users/BlindData.html">BlindData</a>:</b> Yeah I hope so too.</li>
      <li>11/04/2023, 03:01 — <b><a href="admins/Gregory(Greg).html">Gregory(Greg)</a>:</b> Breakdowns of computers, use of Debug Mode, and decoding of OS versions is not advised. Be careful with hardware tampering. Procede at your own risk.</li>
